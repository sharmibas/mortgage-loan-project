CALCULATING MORTGAGE LOAN RISK

Lenders such as banks provide borrowers with a mortgage loan that is paid back monthly for a fixed time-frame. Lenders make
profit by imposing interest; however, the lender assumes risk since a borrower can default, refinance, or prepay their loan, thus
decreasing profitability for the lender. Lenders want to understand the influential factors associated within mortgage loans to
reduce their loss from potentially-risky loans, while borrowers want to minimize their rate.

Calculated the appropriate mortgage rate to charge a potential borrower. This rate is determined by creating a default risk
measure based on borrower characteristics and macroeconomic conditions while accounting for new customers. Based on
the default risk measure,  an interest rate range is estiamted that represents high, average, and low profitability for lenders.
Ultimately, our tool aims to allow users to easily explore historical mortgage default data, and borrowers and lenders to quickly
obtain a range of acceptable interest rate quotes before engaging in the rate setting process.
